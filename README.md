# StoreMesh Argo CD repository

This repository contains the Argo CD `AppProject` and application definitions
for StoreMesh.

The user-service application deploys the chart from
`sartim/storemesh-helm-repo`. Runtime credentials are supplied through the
`storemesh-user-service-secrets` Kubernetes Secret; no secret values belong in
Git.

Apply the project and application after Argo CD is installed:

```sh
kubectl apply -f project.yaml
kubectl apply -f storemesh-user-service-application.yaml
```

The cert-manager application is intentionally separate and should be enabled
only in environments with an ingress controller and an approved certificate
issuance policy:

```sh
kubectl apply -f cert-manager-application.yaml
```

It tracks the official Jetstack OCI chart at a pinned version and manages the
cert-manager CRDs through Argo CD.
